  Dastardly produces a JUnit XML report of the scan on completion. This report will only include vulnerability details if vulnerabilities were found by the scanner.
  If Dastardly finds any issue with a severity level of LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH, it will fail a workflow build.

  The examples below show how to display the vulnerability report in the Tests tab, or to store the raw .xml report as an artifact.
